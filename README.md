This project allows me to search my notebook

Plan is to have it be two different parts:

* doc-search - for searching the documents in my notebook
* telegram-bot - for searching the documents in my notebook from telegram. It should use doc-search and never understand the structure of the documents, as that should be abstracted away.

I want to run this on my server, and have it be accessible from the internet. I want to be able to search my documents from anywhere, and I want to be able to search my documents from telegram.

This readme will be updated as I go along.
